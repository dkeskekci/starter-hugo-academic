### Research question

The research focuses on the interplay between the rise of right-wing populist movements and the topic of Islam as radical, and subsequently addresses the effects of the nexus-radical Islam and right-wing populist movements on Western liberal democracy.

The RaMi Project will explore the following questions:

* What role does the discourse on radical Islam play in the rise of right-wing populism?
* How does right-wing populism link interpretations of radical Islam with the topics of national identity and migration?
* To what extent does the right-wing populist interpretation of Islam as a radical and oppressive religion shape the public discourse on Islam?
* Is the right-wing populist pattern of interpretation being adopted by other political forces and established religious actors, and thus being normalised?
* To what extent is such normalisation being furthered by the mediatisation of politics or by the strategic communication of the right-wing populists, and by the functional logic that underlies the mass media and digital networking platforms?
